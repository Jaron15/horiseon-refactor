# Horiseon refactor 

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the Horiseon websites homepage, in order to make the code more effecient and easily comprehensible. The code that was refactored did not effect the how the page is displayed to the user, however it did fix certain bugs that were making some of the websites features unusable. 

## Actions taken 

* filled in missing quotes around certain styles that were missing them like the font "Calibri"
* fixed the link to the search engine optimization link in the header
* organized the benefits section and the content section so that their HTML elemts are semantic and the CSS follows a logical structure 
* added alt attributes to images 
* added comments to code to make it more organized 
* added a favicon and a more descriptive title
